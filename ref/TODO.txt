PLAN TO FINISH PLEASE:

sorted by importance!!

1- create 2 synthetic datasets (clustered, unclustered)
2- Create runs plan 
    - datasets 5
    - with & without GNN 2
    - AL4GE, [pagerank, entropy, clustered_variance], [pagerank, entropy, density, area_variance] 3

    5 * 2 * 3 = 30

3- correlation and seperation
